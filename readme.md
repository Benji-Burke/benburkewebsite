benburke.website is a normal static basic website that I wanted to really polish since I am now a full fledged "software developer." The original bens-burke.website is my admissions website that I had to turn in when I was first about to enter the coding lifestyle with general assembly. This is something that I've wanted to do. This website is really just my 'mess around webiste,' with the goal of just building a simple html css3 javascript  website without a framework like node. Eventually I might move the website to the node/ejs plateform, nothing too crazy for a website that shows of my life. Really just for practice :)
